# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to your comprehensive guide to **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**! This textbook will take you from fundamentals to advanced concepts in building intelligent robotic systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and learn from the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that exists purely in digital environments, Physical AI:

- **Perceives** the environment through sensors
- **Reasons** about physical interactions and constraints
- **Acts** in the real world through actuators and motors
- **Learns** from physical experiences and feedback

## Why Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots are designed to operate in human environments and interact naturally with people. They represent the cutting edge of robotics because they:

1. **Navigate human spaces** - Stairs, doorways, and furniture designed for human proportions
2. **Use human tools** - Designed for human hands and manipulation
3. **Communicate naturally** - Through gestures, expressions, and body language
4. **Embody human understanding** - Physical form aids in human-robot interaction

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers a comprehensive curriculum designed to take you from beginner to advanced practitioner:

### Core Topics

- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)** - The industry-standard framework for robotics software
- **Simulation Environments** - Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac for virtual robot development
- **Computer Vision** - Perception systems for robots to understand their environment
- **Motion Planning** - Algorithms for navigation and manipulation
- **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)** - Modern AI approaches combining vision, language understanding, and physical actions
- **Hardware Integration** - Sensors, actuators, and embedded systems

### Learning Path

The course is structured as a **13-week intensive program**, progressing through:

1. **Weeks 1-3**: Foundations of robotics and ROS 2
2. **Weeks 4-6**: Simulation and modeling
3. **Weeks 7-9**: Perception and computer vision
4. **Weeks 10-12**: Advanced AI integration and VLA
5. **Week 13**: Final project and integration
