What this README covers

Quick start (high level)
------------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/NAVEED261/HACKATON-1-PIAIC.git
2. Change into the repo directory:
   cd HACKATON-1-PIAIC
3. Follow the detailed instructions in QUICK_START.md:
   https://github.com/NAVEED261/HACKATON-1-PIAIC/blob/master/QUICK_START.md

(For exact commands, prerequisites and environment setup please consult QUICK_START.md. If you prefer, I can extract and show the precise steps here.)

Deployment
----------
Full deployment instructions are provided in DEPLOYMENT.md:
https://github.com/NAVEED261/HACKATON-1-PIAIC/blob/master/DEPLOYMENT.md

Read that file for:
- Building artifacts or Docker images
- Environment variables and secrets
- Cloud or hosting provider steps
- CI/CD notes (if any)

Project status, issues & roadmap
--------------------------------
See PROJECT_STATUS.md for current status, known issues, pending tasks and roadmap:
https://github.com/NAVEED261/HACKATON-1-PIAIC/blob/master/PROJECT_STATUS.md

If you want to track or change priorities, open GitHub issues or update PROJECT_STATUS.md.

Contributing
------------
Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch
- Run the project locally following QUICK_START.md
- Make changes and add tests (where applicable)
- Commit and push your branch, then open a Pull Request describing the change

If you want, I can prepare a CONTRIBUTING.md with specific rules, PR templates, and code style guidelines.

Notes, TODOs & next steps
------------------------
- This README intentionally links to existing detailed docs (QUICK_START.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md) rather than duplicating content.
- If you want a single-file README with full, expanded setup and commands, I can expand this draft to include exact prerequisites and commands (I can extract them from QUICK_START.md).
- After I open the PR, I can also merge it if you want me to (but I won't merge without your explicit go-ahead).
